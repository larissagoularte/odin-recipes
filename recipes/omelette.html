            <ol>
                <li>
                    Crack the eggs into a bowl, add the milk, and season with a pinch of salt and a dash of pepper. Whisk the mixture until well combined.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and add the butter or cooking oil. Allow it to melt and coat the bottom of the pan.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pour the egg mixture into the skillet and let it cook undisturbed for a few moments until the edges begin to set.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sprinkle the grated cheese and diced vegetables evenly over one half of the omelette.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Carefully fold the other half of the omelette over the fillings, creating a half-moon shape.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Continue cooking for a minute or two until the cheese melts and the omelette is cooked to your desired level of doneness.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Place a non-stick skillet or a griddle pan over medium-low heat.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Butter one side of each slice of bread.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place one slice of bread, buttered side down, onto the heated skillet.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Quickly add the cheese slices on top of the bread.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Top with the second slice of bread, buttered side up, creating a sandwich.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Allow the sandwich to cook for a few minutes until the bottom slice of bread turns golden brown and crispy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Carefully flip the sandwich using a spatula and continue cooking until the second side is also golden brown, and the cheese inside is completely melted.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove the sandwich from the skillet, cut it in half diagonally, and serve hot.

    <p class="description">Spaghetti Aglio e Olio is a classic Italian pasta dish known for its simplicity and bold flavors. "Aglio" means garlic, and "Olio" means oil in Italian, and these are the stars of the show in this recipe. The dish is a delightful combination of al dente spaghetti, aromatic sautéed garlic, and the richness of extra-virgin olive oil. A pinch of red pepper flakes (if you like a little heat) and fresh parsley add a touch of elegance to this easy-to-make pasta.</p>
